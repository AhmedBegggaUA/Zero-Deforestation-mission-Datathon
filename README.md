# Zero-Deforestation-mission
##Â Background
Deforestation is the permanent removal of standing forests, which occurs for a variety of reasons and has many devastating consequences. The loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a host of problems for Indigenous people. In the last 13 years, more than 43 million hectares of forest have been devastated in the world, an area the size of California, USA. It is important to stop deforestation, as soon as possible, before the damage is irreversible. There are many ways to fight deforestation. This challenge will consist of using the help of thousands of satellites in space to capture images of the earth's surface in order to detect, as soon as possible, areas in the midst of deforestation and prevent its expansion.
## Dataset
You will have the following attributes to be able to make the classifications:
* latitude: Where the photo latitude was taken.
* longitude: Where the photo longitude was taken.
* year: Year, in which the photo was taken.
* example_path: Path where the sample image is located.
* label: In this column you will have the following categories:
* 'Plantation':Encoded with number 0, Network of rectangular plantation blocks, connected by a well-defined road grid. In hilly areas the layout of the plantation may follow topographic features. In this group you can find: Oil Palm Plantation, Timber Plantation and Other large-scale plantations.
* 'Grassland/Shrubland': Encoded with number 1, Large homogeneous areas with few or sparse shrubs or trees, and which are generally persistent. 
Distinguished by the absence of signs of agriculture, such as clearly defined field boundaries.
* 'Smallholder Agriculture': Encoded with number 2, Small scale area, in which you can find deforestation covered by agriculture, mixed plantation or oil palm plantation.
